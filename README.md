Various C utilities I use to make writing programs nicer.


- strtonum : converts string to long long

- humanize_number : this allows you to convert numbers to human readable numbers.

        ex. 90000 -> 90K


- xmalloc : object checking for malloc, calloc, realloc, strdup, asprintf. It will exit the program is the function failed to allocate the memory needed.


- progressmeter : a nice progress message for file operations
